HLKreedz TODO:
- [ ] Check /speclist as it may be not going off when toggling it.
- [ ] Append ^0 to nicknames in plugin messages, so the color of the text after the nickname isn't messed up. Make a cvar for this as the plugin may be running in vanilla HL without AG mini.
- [x] Make flickering HUD texts (e.g.: spectator list from /speclist) not flicker.
- [ ] Make searchmaps commands follow the same pattern as others preprending a symbol to the say command.
- [ ] Make searchmaps list all the maps in a file (allmaps.txt) if doesn't exist.
- [ ] Implement a lazier load of listmaps (current method takes 2 seconds on every map change).
- [x] Implement communication with Discord via cURL and webhook. 
- [ ] Implement map autochange when timeleft is higher than 30 minutes and no player has been playing in the last hour for at least 3 minutes (all customizable).
- [ ] Implement recovery of last map on crash, maybe with the same timeleft that was remaining. It should do the changelevel automatically even before than any player reconnects after restart (around 15 seconds).
- [ ] Make /ljstats tops. Take into account cl_yawspeed (prohibited as it modifies side speed?).
- [ ] Add jump count and max speed to leaderboards (maybe not to be displayed yet, or pure/pro-only because in noob cp/tp columns already take too much space).
- [ ] Make /rtv display instructions on how to vote (for new AG players). Display a message saying that X player have just created a vote to change map immediately.
- [x] Add fireworks on new WR at end button position.
- [ ] Fix spectator mode. When a player teleports to start, the spectators watching him will see him as frozen where he was before teleporting.
- [ ] Implement a tournament mode in HL KreedZ. See #7 for details.
	- [x] Basic implementation with _ABBA bans + BA pick + Decider_ format.
	- [ ] Implement _AB bans + BA picks + AB bans + Decider_ format.
	- [ ] Add a permanent HUD element to show the current match score (p 1 - 2 x).
	- [ ] Add a cvar to disable healthboosters during matches.
	- [ ] Teleport players to /start position BEFORE the agstart countdown starts.
	- [ ] Add info to the map pool HUD about who did each ban/pick.
	- [ ] When the previous point is completed, fix the map change feature to change to the correct map in Bo5+ cases where no 2 same-player-picks should be played in sequence, so it changes to some player A's pick, then to some player B's pick, then to some player A's pick, and so on until the decider. Or just show a menu to the corresponding player when one of their picks had to be played, so they select the pick they want to play (may prefer to play one map before the other, because the other may actually never be played if the match is won 3 - 0 or 3 - 1 in a Bo5).
	- [ ] Implement a replay system for cup matches (demos are already being recorded for all cup matches independent of runners pressing the end button or not, just have to recognize that demo naming format).
		- [ ] Recognize cup demo naming format.
		- [ ] Add the ability to replay more than 1 demo at a time (so the match can be replayed entirely, being able to watch both participants, and even 2 matches or more at a time to see all the runs in a given map at a time).
	- [ ] Add an optional warmup time (before readying up).
	- [ ] Sort map pool by name after sorting it by state (currently only being sorted by state).
- [ ] Make spectator speed customizable per player (e.g.: /specspeed 500).
- [ ] Implement commands to show tops of any other map.
- [ ] Implement cookies to store client preferences.
- [ ] Implement achievements and ranks (ie. Diamond rank if you finish 5 classic maps in 1st-3rd position... Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze...).
- [ ] Implement a small tool to measure distances ingame (by aiming position, etc.).
- [x] Implement replay bot, so players can see how worldrecords or other records are done.
- [ ] Implement custom replays, not replays of full runs, but thinking more of small strats or skips.
- [ ] Add a menu for replays, so you can choose a record to replay or change replay settings.
- [ ] Add some commands to rewind and change the speed of the replay (not the same as changing replay framerate).
- [ ] Add a command to autospawn a ghost of the top1 or own PB when hitting the start button.
- [ ] Add a command to reveal markers in the points where the top1 (or any other) performed a jump, so it's easier to learn a good route.
- [ ] Make replay framerate customizable. If the demo was recorded at a lower framerate, calculate the missing frames (maybe it's only possible to multiply the framerate by an integer, e.g.: it would be possible to upgrade from 125 fps to 250 fps (x2), 375 fps (x3), 500 fps (x4), etc., but not possible from 125 fps to 144 fps (x1.152) or 200 fps (x1.6)).
- [ ] Add an admin command for record removal, which updates the tops in real-time for all players.
- [ ] Add an admin MOTD showing all connected players' variable states (e.g.: naz - LJStats ON, Speed OFF, NV mode 2, speclist OFF, etc.).
- [ ] Custom training stages for HLDM maps like crossfire, boot_camp, stalkyard, etc. In these maps, a special menu pops up to enable a specific training area (e.g.: crossfire from mp5 balcony to crossbow balcony to gauss), so it teleports the player to the specific start button and disables the other buttons in the map while that training area is selected.
- [x] Add database support, so we can have data organized and easily display through web, Discord, Telegram, ingame, etc.
- [ ] Implement a command to see personal stats (un/played maps, how many 1st positions, etc.) when SQL is implemented.
- [ ] Implement map staging:
	- [ ] Add an ingame editor to place trigger_multiple blocks that start/end a stage, so different stages of a map can be measured when running (like can be seen when watching a HL speedrun in Twitch).
	- [ ] Make some HUD messages visible to the runner and spectators watching him, that show the runner's time in different stages and diff against the PB.
	- [ ] Save stage records to another file or to the same top15 table if SQL is already implemented.
- [ ] Make a script to change mapcycle automatically by combining some classic maps and some unknown maps (with no records or a few).
- [ ] Make a coop mode. Players of the same team have full clipping and the first who makes a record sets the record for their whole team. Teams can make strategies to make human ladders, etc.
- [ ] Improve surfbug fix.
- [ ] Add a nice style to all MOTDs. This requires a modification in the OpenAG client.
- [ ] Add noclip (requested by *Muty*)

Other weird ideas:
- [ ] Add a Tag game (chase other players running, with a crowbar to hit them).
- [ ] Add a Backwards top (runs from end button to start button).
- [ ] Add a Scriptless top (check cl_autojump).
